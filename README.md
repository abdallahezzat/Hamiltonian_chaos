# Hamiltonian chaos
Exploring the behaviour of stars orbits

## The program

This code plots 3D orbits and Poincaré maps of _N_ stars in a galaxy assuming a logarithmic potential with parameters _b_ and _c_.

## Paramters and initial conditions
The number of stars _N_, timestep _dt_, and total time _T_ are specified in **data.txt**.

The initial conditions for the stars (positions and velocities) can be manually changed in line _36_ of **main.py**.

## Usage

Running the file main.py will produce three plots for the stars trajectories, Poincaré maps and energy. The parameters _b_ and _c_ are randomly generated and stored in **parameters.txt** file.
